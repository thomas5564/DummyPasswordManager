I made this password manager which has some vulnerabilities that can be exploited:

1.Plaintext Storage: 
Passwords are stored in a plainteext csv are txt file, making them easily accessible if the file is compromised.
Hence, if the text file is not restricted via enryption or other means, other users can access the CSV file and steal credentials.

2.Sudo Privileges: 
Running the script as root exposes the system to potential command injection and complete system compromise.

3.Insecure Input Handling:
Lack of input sanitization makes the script vulnerable to injection attacks or data corruption. 

4. Hardcoded File Path:
Predictable file location allows attackers to target it directly for credential theft.

5. Potential Path Traversal:
   The file path isnâ€™t validated, opening the possibility for manipulation or overwriting critical files.

6. Lack of Error Handling: 
    No checks for file read/write failures, leading to potential data loss or script malfunction
