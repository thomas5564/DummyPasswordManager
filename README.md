This is a vulnerable password manager, here is why it is vulnerable.

Plaintext Storage: 
Passwords are stored in plaintext, making them easily accessible if the file is compromised.

Weak File Permissions: If not restricted via enryption or other means other users can access the CSV file and steal credentials.

Sudo Privileges: Running the script as root exposes the system to potential command injection and complete system compromise.

Insecure Input Handling: Lack of input sanitization makes the script vulnerable to injection attacks or data corruption. 

Password Display in Terminal: Sensitive information like passwords is displayed in plaintext, risking exposure through shoulder-surfing or terminal logs.

Hardcoded File Path: Predictable file location allows attackers to target it directly for credential theft.

Race Conditions: Multiple script instances can lead to data corruption if they access the file simultaneously.

No Authentication: Anyone running the script can view all stored passwords without needing to authenticate.

Potential Path Traversal: The file path isnâ€™t validated, opening the possibility for manipulation or overwriting critical files.

Lack of Error Handling: No checks for file read/write failures, leading to potential data loss or script malfunction
